While happy in the ivory towers of learning, I do not forget to make my rigorous studies in mathematics and economics applicable to fields like finance and analytics through proficiency with tools and skills for quantitative modeling and actionable insights. If this sounds potentially valuable for your organization, please reach out, and I'd be thrilled to take a break from lamenting the Battle of Nancy to discuss opportunities!
