Hello! I’m currently looking for internship opportunities in finance or other industries where I can exercise my strong quantitative abilities. Apart from developing an efficient mindset of both logical and creative thinking, my rigorous studies in mathematics and economics have equipped me with the analytical skills and technical tools to model real-world processes and provide actionable insights. If any of this sounds potentially valuable to your organization, please don’t hesitate to reach out, and I’d be happy to talk!
